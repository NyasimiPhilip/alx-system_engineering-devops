#!/usr/bin/env bash
# This script is written in Bash and starts with the shebang line '#!/usr/bin/env bash',
# which tells the system to use the 'bash' interpreter to execute the script.

# The next line 'echo "$$"' prints the process ID (PID) of the current running script.
# The '$$' is a special variable in Bash that represents the PID of the current process.
# When you run the script, it will display the PID of the running script.

# Note that the script ends with a tilde character '~' without any further instructions.
# The tilde is an expansion symbol, typically used for user home directory expansion.
# However, in this script, it is not followed by any instructions or commands, so it has no effect.
# It might be possible that there is a missing part of the script, or it was cut off prematurely.
# As it stands, the script only prints the PID and does not perform any additional actions.

echo "$$"
